// //As a user I can see a 10 x 10 grid so that I can see the gameboard.
//
// As a user when I click on a position, the position changes color so that I can tell that a position has been torpedoed.
//
// As a user I can see how many torpedoes I have used, so that I can keep track of how many I have used.
//
// As a user once a position has been torpedoed, it cannot be torpedoed again so that I don't waste torpedoes.
//
// As user I expect there to be 5 single length ships on the board.
//
// As a user when I click on a position I can see if there was a ship at that location so that I can see if I hit a ship. If there is a ship it counts as a hit.
//
// As a user I have won the game when I have 5 hits on the board, so that I know when the game is won and over.
//
// As a user I have a limit of 25 torpedoes to hit all ships, and when I run out I have lost the game, so that that game is a challenge.
//
// As a user if I lose, I can see where the ships were, so that I know there were actual ships on the board.
